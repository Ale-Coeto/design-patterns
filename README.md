# Design Patterns

## Structural
Structural design patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

### Adapter
Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

### Bridge
Lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.
Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

### Decorator
Attach additional responsibilities or behaviors to an object dynamically.

### Facade
Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
