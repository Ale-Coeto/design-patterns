# Design Patterns

## Structural
Structural design patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

### Adapter
Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

### Decorator
Attach additional responsibilities or behaviors to an object dynamically.
